Project Introduction:
We are building a ChaCha20 encryption program. A spy will send their secret information into this program to be encrypted. When Headquarters receives this encrupted data, they will use the program to decrpyt the data and save the world. Our goals for this project is to build a ChaCha20 encrytion program that will take in a file with data and encrypt using the ChaCha20 algorithm, we also want to be able to decrypt the data at a later point and print it out without any loss of data. We chose this project because we both love cybersecurity topics and found encryption and decrytion a very interesting topic, especially the complex math algorithms that certain programs utalize to encrypt data very securly. After some time researching online we found ChaCha20. Most encryption programs are reliant on a fixed-size blocks of data, but ChaCha20 is not reliant and is very flexible. We also found the qaurter-rounds very interesting and so decided to create a ChaCha20 program. We chose for it to be a spy program because ChaCha20 is commonly used in file encrpytion and we wanted a fun story to go along with our program.

Technical Overview
Please provide a moderate-length technical description of the major components of your project. This should also function as a sort of ‘roadmap’ for tasks you need to complete for your project to be functional.
Please list what you plan to have finished by each checkpoint. These are meant to be goals to keep your project on track. We will NOT grade your checkpoints on how much you have completed, but on whether or not you’ve made some progress. 
Possible Challenges
Please list some of the challenges you foresee running into.
This can be learning a new crate interface, working with a UI in Rust, etc…
